About
---
A macOS app that automatically generates `.vtt` caption tracks for video or audio files.

Requirements
---
- macOS Big Sur (11.0 or later)
- Ask Siri enabled

Installation
---
- *Preferred method:* Use the git CLI to clone this repository onto your mac. Then unzip Captioner.
- *Alternative method:* Download this repository as a zip file. Unzip the folder, then unzip Captioner.

Notes
---
- Only English captioning is supported currently.
- Captioning takes ~60% of the duration of the video to finish. So if the video is 1 hour and 40 minutes long, then the captions will be ready in about 1 hour. You can leave the app running in the background while doing other work.
- If you are using the app to caption recorded conference calls (e.g. lectures), the quality of the captions will depend mostly on the speaker's microphone and internet connection at the time of recording.
- If you are an online course instructor, you may also find [Cahootery](https://cahootery.herokuapp.com/) useful.
